# r.sine Easter Eggs Finder

## Description
[r.sine](https://r.sine.com/index) (and [sine](https://sine.com/index)) is a website that displays a random image or gif each time the page is refreshed. 
The site can be accessed at https://sine.com/index. However, while poking around, 
I realized that if you replace "index" with other words, the images are no longer random. We have 3 possible cases. 
Either the word displays random images (e.g. https://sine.com/index ), or the word displays a single image 
(e.g. https://sine.com/admin), or the word displays a "buffer" image which is used for several words, 
probably when the word is not addressed to an image. I decided to use a script to discover all the possible words to use.
Yes, it's stupid. Welcome to the internet.

## Where to find r.sine

The most well-known URL is [https://r.sine.com/index](https://r.sine.com/index).  
Unfortunately, it is currently returning a *Forbidden* error and we no longer have access to that server.  
Thankfully, [https://sine.com/index](https://sine.com/index) still works and provides the same functionality.


## How it works

So it's a pretty straightforward process. We know that "index" offers random images (**Cond1**), 
that some words link to the same photo (**Cond2**) and that some words are only affiliated with a single image (**Cond3**).

- **Cond1**: random image ‚Üí ```random_pictures.txt```
- **Cond2**: buffer image used for several words ‚Üí ```same_pictures.txt```
- **Cond3**: single image for one word ‚Üí ```unique_pictures.txt``` | single image for 2 or more words ‚Üí ```unique_pictures_2words.txt```

So basically, we make requests for each word in the dictionary !
For this, I use either [Wikipedia's word frequency lists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000) 
or [```words.txt```](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt) from [english-words GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
The word list I'm using has a problem... Those are only lowercase words. And certain words in lowercase do not give the same image as in uppercase so my script obviously tests both versions.

| https://sine.com/science                                           | https://sine.com/SCIENCE                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <img style = "width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="image/science.jpg"> | <img style = "width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="image/SCIENCE.gif"> |


Then I make a first request for a specific word and retrieve the image source code. 
I make a second request with the same word. If the 2 source codes are not similar, 
then we're in the case of the word "index" for example, where we'll only have random images (**Cond1**). 
If the 2 source codes are similar, this means that the image is necessarily identical and that the word leads 
to a specific image. 
Then, if the 2 source codes are identical, I check whether the latter is similar to a source code already known for 
the other words already screened. If it's identical, then the word leads to the "buffer" image (**Cond2**). 
If not, the word leads to a unique image (**Cond3**).

After that, I made the script to limit the number of requests, but that's a technicality that no one cares about.

## How to test word

Just replace ```index``` from https://sine.com/index with an other word (e.g. ```advice```) ‚Üí https://sine.com/advice
<img style = "width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="image/advice.jpg"/>

For V4, I use [EazyPeazyE](https://www.reddit.com/r/rsine/comments/1c6woud/comment/l067o3m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
suggestion by using https://sine.com/index?html=true. With this technique, below the photo we have the name associated with the image. I have with a threading of 8, I reloaded the page for 24 hours and retrieved all the words that came out and the source codes associated with the images to sort them as explained later.

## Sorted words and examples

``output`` (and version) are the post-processing folders. Sometimes my script makes errors because it goes too fast for server responses I think. So I go through the word list several times to be sure and I have a ``False Discovery Rate (FDR)`` folder to test it.

Here, I explain in more detail my reasoning and how I sorted.

- **Cond1**: random image ‚Üí ```random_pictures.txt``` (e.g. https://sine.com/index for legal reasons, I don't display random images)


- **Cond2**: buffer image used for several words ‚Üí ```same_pictures.txt``` (e.g. https://sine.com/nicetry)
  <img style = "width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="image/noneed.gif"/>


- **Cond3**: 
  - single image for one word ‚Üí ```unique_pictures.txt``` (e.g. https://sine.com/admin)
    <img style = "width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="image/admin.gif"/>
  - single image for 2 or more words ‚Üí ```unique_pictures_2words.txt``` (e.g. https://sine.com/bird and https://sine.com/parrot)
  
    | https://sine.com/bird                                            | https://sine.com/parrot                                            |

I think this is a reference to the method to prevent Google bots from scanning the site. That makes rsine a deep web site, I guess

#### [```r```](https://sine.com/r)

I don't know if it's a bug or if it's intentional. It's a piece of code that helps us understand how images are returned to us on https://sine.com/index.

These words are broken and we have no source code for the image so probably the photos no longer exist

#### [```javascript```](https://sine.com/javascript) [```somuchgritty```](https://sine.com/somuchgritty)

Access forbidden, Oddly, with ``index`` we can have access to them but why give the possibility of coming across these pages by chance?

#### [```hey+you```](https://sine.com/hey%2Byou)

Request more investigation. Oddly, with ``index`` we can have access to it but I don't have the source code but if we search for it manually I can't find them
However, there is this image which has almost the same name: [https://sine.com/heyyou](https://sine.com/heyyou)

#### [```loaded? don't take chances with pickups!```](https://sine.com/loaded?%20don%27t%20take%20chances%20with%20pickups!)

Probably this image but I can't display it on r.sine.com [https://vdarchive.newmedialab.cuny.edu/items/show/229](https://vdarchive.newmedialab.cuny.edu/items/show/229)

## Is it done ?

I think we found everything, then if we looked carefully... the creator left a clue üòâ but you won't find it in this GitHub üòâ
