## Description
[r.sine](https://r.sine.com/index) is a website that displays a random image or gif each time the page is refreshed. 
The site can be accessed at https://r.sine.com/index. However, while poking around, 
I realized that if you replace "index" with other words, the images are no longer random. We have 3 possible cases. 
Either the word displays random images (e.g. https://r.sine.com/index ), or the word displays a single image 
(e.g. https://r.sine.com/admin), or the word displays a "buffer" image which is used for several words, 
probably when the word is not addressed to an image. I decided to use a script to discover all the possible words to use.
Yes, it's stupid. Welcome to the internet.

## How it works

So it's a pretty straightforward process. We know that "index" offers random images (**Cond1**), 
that some words link to the same photo (**Cond2**) and that some words are only affiliated with a single image (**Cond3**).

- **Cond1**: random image ‚Üí ```random_pictures.txt```
- **Cond2**: buffer image used for several words ‚Üí ```same_pictures.txt```
- **Cond3**: single image for one word ‚Üí ```unique_pictures.txt``` | single image for 2 or more words ‚Üí ```unique_pictures_2words.txt```

So basically, we make requests for each word in the dictionary !
For this, I use either [Wikipedia's word frequency lists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000) 
or [```words.txt```](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt) from [english-words GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
The word list I'm using has a problem... Those are only lowercase words. And certain words in lowercase do not give the same image as in uppercase so my script obviously tests both versions.

Then I make a first request for a specific word and retrieve the image source code. 
I make a second request with the same word. If the 2 source codes are not similar, 
then we're in the case of the word "index" for example, where we'll only have random images (**Cond1**). 
If the 2 source codes are similar, this means that the image is necessarily identical and that the word leads 
to a specific image. 
Then, if the 2 source codes are identical, I check whether the latter is similar to a source code already known for 
the other words already screened. If it's identical, then the word leads to the "buffer" image (**Cond2**). 
If not, the word leads to a unique image (**Cond3**).

After that, I made the script to limit the number of requests, but that's a technicality that no one cares about.

## How to test word

Just replace ```index``` from https://r.sine.com/index with an other word (e.g. ```advice```) ‚Üí https://r.sine.com/advice
<img style = "width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://r.sine.com/advice"/>

## Sorted words and examples

``output`` (and version) are the post-processing folders. Sometimes my script makes errors because it goes too fast for server responses I think. So I go through the word list several times to be sure and I have a ``False Discovery Rate (FDR)`` folder to test it.

Here, I explain in more detail my reasoning and how I sorted.

- **Cond1**: random image ‚Üí ```random_pictures.txt``` (e.g. https://r.sine.com/index for legal reasons, I don't display random images)


- **Cond2**: buffer image used for several words ‚Üí ```same_pictures.txt``` (e.g. https://r.sine.com/nicetry)
I don't know why this one don't works to display the image <img style = "width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://r.sine.com/nicetry"/>


- **Cond3**: 
  - single image for one word ‚Üí ```unique_pictures.txt``` (e.g. https://r.sine.com/admin)
    <img style = "width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://r.sine.com/admin"/>
  - single image for 2 or more words ‚Üí ```unique_pictures_2words.txt``` (e.g. https://r.sine.com/bird and https://r.sine.com/parrot)
  
    | https://r.sine.com/bird                                                   | https://r.sine.com/parrot                                                   |

## [Special words folder](special_words)

In the [```special_words```](special_words) folder, you will find all the words leading to unique outputs (**Cond3**).

üí° *Hint: you can click on the titles and names to directly access them*

### List of words founds:
- [``compilation_unique_pictures.txt``](special_words/compilation_unique_pictures.txt)
- [``compilation_unique_pictures_2words.txt``](special_words/compilation_unique_pictures_2words.txt)

### List of words that do not lead to images:

*Note 1: some words are internet pages. They are no longer executable on r.sine.com but I host them (on Netlify) so that you have access to them.*

*Note 2: since certain words do not lead to images, in the [```special_words```](special_words) folder you will find the source code given by the word in question (in html or txt or pdf version)*

## Is it done ?

I don't know. I stupidly sifted words. And I know that certain words are not there (example: www; I still added it in the output). There are probably still plenty of words and ester eggs. If you know words that I didn't find, put them in [Issues](https://github.com/Jumitti/r.sine-easter_eggs/issues) or on [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rsine/comments/17t51o6/rsine_easter_eggs/).
